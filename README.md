### Manual auditing processes are currently inefficient and prone to inaccuracies

Audits verify that ballot-counting machines register votes correctly. Manually recounting every vote is time consuming. The process is error-prone. The auditor has to record votes while comparing to machine's result and count votes quickly without making mistakes.

Ballot auditors are usually older and less familiar with computer interfaces. There is a need for a clean and efficient user interface to improve this task.

*Truevote* provides a simple way for auditors to record votes and quickly aggregate results.

This project was developed during the spring of 2013 for 6.813 User Interface Design and Implementation, an MIT class in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department. Our project won the award for best support for a different population.
